# Local Installation
Make sure the newest version of Python is installed, as is Docker and its neo4j image.

Run `scripts\install` to make sure all prerequisites are installed.

To launch the service locally, run `scripts\docker` and `scripts\webclient` and keep both command prompts/shell windows open while using the service.

The service should now be running and available on `localhost:8234`.
